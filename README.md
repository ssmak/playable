## A remote Youtube player based on Youtube API & socket.io (Full web based solution)

## History
I have a daughter. She is 3 years old and likes watching Youtube on iPad.
However, I am very concerned with her eyes. So, why not moving the view
to a large TV rather than the small and brightness screen.<br /><br />
This project is tried to bring the view from iPad to a large TV or monitor but
leaving the control in the iPad (So the child can be still happy on touch, touch, touch..)

## How to
1) Clone this repository on your computer - https://github.com/ssmak/playable.git<br />
git clone https://github.com/ssmak/playable.git<br />

2) npm install

3) node index.js --port 12345 --debug

## Browser (Assume you listen on the address 127.0.0.1:8080
View: http//:127.0.0.1:8080<br />
Remote: http://127.0.01:8080/remote

Have fun && Enjoy!!
